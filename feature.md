/**
 * Feature Prompt: "Create Next Todo via Modal - Continuous Workflow Enhancement"
 * 
 * OVERVIEW:
 * Implement an intelligent modal system that automatically prompts users to create the next todo
 * when all current todos are completed, ensuring uninterrupted productivity flow.
 * 
 * CORE FUNCTIONALITY:
 * 1. Auto-Detection: Monitor todo completion state in real-time
 * 2. Delayed Prompt: Show modal after configurable delay (default: 20 seconds)
 * 3. Seamless Integration: Maintain timer state and queue mode continuity
 * 4. Focus Management: Ensure modal captures user attention appropriately
 * 
 * DETAILED REQUIREMENTS:
 * 
 * A. TRIGGER CONDITIONS:
 *    - All todos in the current queue are completed (estimateSeconds <= 0)
 *    - Timer has finished counting down the last todo
 *    - No active todo remains (activeTodoId === null)
 *    - Queue mode is active (queueMode === true)
 *    - Background timer has stopped due to completion
 * 
 * B. MODAL BEHAVIOR:
 *    - Appears 20 seconds after all todos completion
 *    - Overlay covers entire application with semi-transparent backdrop
 *    - Modal is centered, responsive, and follows existing design system
 *    - Cannot be dismissed by clicking outside or pressing Escape
 *    - Only dismissible by creating a new todo or explicit cancel action
 *    - Focus is trapped within the modal (accessibility compliance)
 * 
 * C. MODAL CONTENT:
 *    - Header: "What's next to do?" or "Ready for your next task?"
 *    - Subtitle: Motivational text like "Keep the momentum going!"
 *    - Input fields matching existing todo form:
 *      * Task title (required, auto-focused)
 *      * Time estimate (number input, default: 25)
 *      * Unit selector (minutes/hours dropdown, default: minutes)
 *    - Action buttons:
 *      * "Add & Start" (primary button - creates todo and starts timer)
 *      * "Add More" (secondary - creates todo, keeps modal open for batch adding)
 *      * "Take a Break" (tertiary - dismisses modal, stops workflow)
 * 
 * D. INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING SYSTEMS:
 *    - Use existing todo creation logic from todoForm submission
 *    - Maintain localStorage persistence (todos.v1 key)
 *    - Integrate with background timer system (main.js)
 *    - Respect queue mode and timer state management
 *    - Update progress bar and display elements
 *    - Trigger notifications for workflow continuation
 * 
 * E. TIMER CONTINUATION:
 *    - After creating new todo via modal:
 *      * Automatically set new todo as active (activeTodoId)
 *      * Resume queue mode with updated todo list
 *      * Start background timer with new total remaining time
 *      * Update tray title and focus window
 *      * Show brief success notification
 * 
 * F. CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:
 *    - Delay before modal appears (default: 20s, configurable 5-60s)
 *    - Enable/disable auto-prompt feature
 *    - Customize modal messages and motivational text
 *    - Option to auto-start timer after todo creation
 * 
 * IMPLEMENTATION ARCHITECTURE:
 * 
 * 1. DETECTION SYSTEM (renderer.js):
 *    - Monitor `completeAllTodos()` function calls
 *    - Track todo completion state changes
 *    - Implement countdown timer for modal delay
 *    - Handle edge cases (window focus, user activity)
 * 
 * 2. MODAL COMPONENT (new):
 *    - Create reusable modal component with proper styling
 *    - Implement focus trap using existing patterns
 *    - Handle form validation and submission
 *    - Manage modal state and lifecycle
 * 
 * 3. BACKGROUND TIMER INTEGRATION (main.js):
 *    - Extend `completeAllTodos()` to trigger modal countdown
 *    - Add IPC handlers for modal-related events
 *    - Ensure proper state synchronization
 *    - Handle notifications and sound effects
 * 
 * 4. STATE MANAGEMENT:
 *    - Add modal state to existing timer state object
 *    - Persist modal preferences to localStorage
 *    - Synchronize state between main and renderer processes
 *    - Handle window focus and visibility changes
 * 
 * TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
 * 
 * A. CSS STYLING:
 *    - Follow existing design system (style.css patterns)
 *    - Use CSS Grid/Flexbox for responsive layout
 *    - Implement smooth animations (fade-in, scale)
 *    - Ensure high contrast and accessibility
 *    - Support dark/light theme compatibility
 * 
 * B. JAVASCRIPT IMPLEMENTATION:
 *    - Use existing ES6+ patterns and conventions
 *    - Implement proper error handling and validation
 *    - Follow existing event handling patterns
 *    - Maintain code modularity and reusability
 *    - Add comprehensive logging for debugging
 * 
 * C. IPC COMMUNICATION:
 *    - Add new IPC channels for modal events:
 *      * 'modal:show' - trigger modal display
 *      * 'modal:hide' - dismiss modal
 *      * 'modal:createTodo' - handle todo creation
 *      * 'modal:configure' - update modal settings
 * 
 * D. ACCESSIBILITY:
 *    - ARIA labels and roles for screen readers
